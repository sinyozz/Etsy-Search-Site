      "description":"Are you or do you know a Green Bay Packers fan?  This year has been a rollercoaster of a season, from the depths of 4 wins and 6 losses to KINGS OF THE NORTH!  Certainly, the Pack performed a heck of a turnaround to RUN THE TABLE!  Not only are the Green Bay Packers the NFC North Division Champions but they&#39;re currently taking care of business in the playoffs.  \n\nThey started by defeating the NY Giants at Lambeau and then defeated the #1 seed Dallas Cowboys, in their backyard with a last second game winning Field Goal.  That game nearly gave me a heart attack.  Now the Green Bay Packers are only one win from going to the Super Bowl and two wins away from bringing the Lombardi Trophy home!  Celebrate this crazy season with your very own Go Pack Go Shot Glass.\n\nThese items work great as gifts to others, or even to yourself, go ahead, you deserve it!  Birthdays, Weddings, Fathers or Mothers Day, Housewarming Parties, Playoff Parties, Super Bowl Parties, or stock up for the Opening Week of the 2017 season.  Don&#39;t forget about Christmas, Hannukah, or make up your own excuse for a gift day, you name it!\n\nIf you would like to customize this item with a name, date or anything else, please add it to the Note to Seller section when checking out or start a conversation with me and I&#39;ll be happy to work with you on making it just right!\n\nThanks for taking a look and GO PACK GO!",

        "announcement":"When Do You Give Your Groomsmen Gifts?\r\nWhen personally handing the invitation? -Giving groomsmen gifts as early as when the invitations are handed out isn\u2019t really common, but it can certainly be done.\r\n \r\nAt the rehearsal dinner? -Rehearsal dinners are typically held right after the wedding rehearsal a day before the wedding. This is a great time to give gifts that are intended to be used during the wedding ceremony itself.\r\n\r\nAn hour before the Wedding? - Giving groomsmen gifts an hour before the wedding may not really seem practical considering that during that time, your groomsmen would already have been at the wedding venue all dressed up and ready to go, but it does have its advantages - You have all of your groomsmen in one place, making distribution a lot easier, if your gifts are something for your groomsmen to wear during the ceremony, you\u2019ll be assured that they won\u2019t have forgotten it at home. Perfect.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding reception? - The wedding reception is usually the last chance to give out groomsmen gifts.  Functional yet creative items that your guys can use in their daily lives can be handed out during the speeches and is a perfect way to say thank you to the guys who have got you through \u2018the best day of your life\u2019.  \r\n\r\nBUT REMEMBER - It&#39;s your day, so do it your way!!",

      "title":"Vintage Scotch Dictionary Print - Cocktail Art - Print on Vintage Dictionary Paper - Scotch Whisky, Whiskey, Mad Men Decor - On The Rocks",
      "description":"A vintage scotch dictionary print of a glass of scotch whisky, printed on vintage dictionary paper.  A perfect gift for him in decorating that man cave, home bar, den, or garage with some classy bar themed wall art.  Inspired by Mad Men, this image of a poured cocktail is sure to help your man take the edge off.\n\nFrame and mat are shown for display purposes only and are not included. Want a frame? Add one to your order here: http:\/\/etsy.me\/1bWBZO4\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nVintage dictionary art is a unique process in which we &quot;upcycle&quot; old dictionaries by hand into a beautiful new piece of art. The desirably yellowed pages of our vintage dictionaries present a classy and sophisticated look that works magic for any interior decorating project. It doesn&#39;t matter if your style is modern, vintage, or for the college dorm. Each print comes on a different page of the dictionary, so no two are alike. If you would like to request a page with a certain definition, please send me a message and I will confirm availability.\n\nPAPER SIZE\n\nOur prints do not come framed or matted, however they are printed to perfectly fit them. By default, every print measures approximately 8.5x11 inches. However, each print is sized such that the printed design is fully visible when used with a standard frame matted to 8x10 (i.e. with a viewable window size of 7.5 x 9.5). The margins of the page will fit neatly behind your mat and allow you to easily attach your print to the mat.\n\nPlease let me know if you intend to display your print in an unmatted 8.5x11 document frame, and I will slightly adjust the print scaling to fill out the entire page. If you would like the print to measure an exact 8x10 inches, I am happy to trim the margins of the page for you. This option is available by special request in the notes section at checkout.\n\nSHIPPING\n\nAll of our prints ship in durable cardboard mailers via USPS First Class Mail. Prints will ship within 1-3 business days of your order, but in most cases, I am able to ship the next day. USPS provides delivery confirmation for all domestic shipments. Delivery time is generally 2-3 business days. Shipping upgrades available upon request.\n\nFor international orders, we use USPS First Class International. Please note that due to your country&#39;s postal service or customs inspections, prints can take anywhere from 7 to 30 business days to arrive. Due to the high cost of upgraded international shipping, tracking is not included by default with international orders. International shipping upgrades available upon request. Approximate delivery times to Canada and the UK are 5-10 business days.\n\n\u00a9 2015 DictionArt. All rights reserved.",

        "policy_additional":"What is Engraving? Laser Engraving in the process or art of cutting or carving a design on a hard surface, especially so as to make a print or design. \n\nOn wood type products the engraving will remove layers of the wood creating a carving that you can feel to the touch. On these types of products most will be color filled to enhance the engraving or to make it &quot;pop&quot; drawing your attention to the engraved word or design. The color fill will not actually fill in the engraving and you will still be able to feel it.\nFor cutting boards it is suggested that you used the side not engraved and wash with warm soap and water. Please treat cutting board with oil to prevent the wood from drying out.\nOn Bamboo cutting boards and other bamboo products please note that the bamboo is a natural product that is built in different layers together that will cause a shade or a slight variance in color. Please note no two pieces are a like so the board will slightly differ in color and grain pattern, including the engraving on different sections on the same piece.\n\nOn glass\/crystal type products the laser literally removes small pieces about the size of sand from the glass\/crystal to create a frosted look. The frosted look is permanently cut into the products and will have a slightly rough feeling to the touch and can have a raised feeling to it. Strong glass\/crystal must be used because the laser is effecting the stability of the product. If a thin product is used the glass\/crystal could break under very hot or cold temperatures. It is HIGHLY recommended that all engraved glass\/crystal is only hand washed with no abrasive cleaners or scrubbers. An abrasive cleaner or scrubber can effect the engraving making a section of the engraving look lighter or darker then another section. If you accidentally use a abrasive cleaner and you get a slight color change you can try lightly buffing the entire engraving with a Mr. Clean or sponge with a light abrasive.\n**All color filled glasses can only be hand washed, no exceptions. All color fill is guaranteed permanent if hand washed. If for any reason (including accidentally dish washing) the color fill starts to fade I offer free new color fill buffing on your items, however all shipping cost will be the responsibility of the purchaser.\n\nOn flasks products the engraving will remove the anodized aluminum (the color on the flasks) revealing the stainless steel underneath. On the stainless steel flasks a bonding agent will be used so when it is placed on the flask and subjected to high heat (from the laser) the bonding agent will turn black in the area of the wording\/design.\nAll flasks should be washed with warm soap and water and no abrasive cleaners. An abrasive cleaner can effect the bonding agent as well as the anodized aluminum.\n\nI accept custom orders!  Do you have a design in mind? Give me a shout!\n\nAll artwork, reproductions, and images on https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KustomProducts are copyrighted (c) by Kathleen Cheever. All rights reserved.\n\nCommon Questions:\n\n1. How long until I get my products?\n\nProcessing time for most items is 3-5 business days. Please remember that each item is customized to your specifications and therefore take a little time to create. The processing time does not include shipping, shipping is based on where you live and the shipping method you choose.\n\n2. I need my items quicker then the processing time offered is this possible?\n\nYes! Rush processing is available however there will be an extra fee involved. Rush processing fee is based on the number of items, weight of items, where the items will be shipped to, and how quickly those items are needed. All rush processes are &quot;after hours.&quot; No item will reserve priority over another and all items all processed in the order that they are received. If you need an order rushed, the order will be fulfilled after hours so to not effect the order of the other items. Please note that part of the rush processing fee is the cost of an employee working after hours.\n\n3. What are the extra fees and why are there extra fees?\n\nThe extra fees will very by item. Some of the extra fees could be:\n-Priority Shipping-based on the amount and weight of the item along with where the items need to be shipped to.\n-Rush Processing-Please understand that EVERYONE needs\/wants their items as quickly as possible and one customer&#39;s item will for NO reason be placed in priority over another customers item. Because of this all rush processing orders are filled after hours or on weekends and will occur and rush processing fee. All rush processing fees will be in the range of $5-$50 depending on the size of the project and how quickly the items are needed.\n\n4. What mail carrier do you use and how long will it take to receive my items once they are shipped.\n\nAt the current time my main provider is USPS with very few packages being shipped out FedEx. USPS website states the following for shipping in the 48 USA:\nAll items under 13 oz 2-5 days\nAll other items 2-9 days\nPriority items 1-3 days\n\nUSPS Shipping outside the USA:\nStandard Mail 5-16 Business Days\nPriority Mail 6-10 Business Days\nExpress Mail 3-5 Business Days\n\n**ALL customs can stop and hold packages for any amount of time and is not covered by shipping times, if customs is holding your item the average time is 4-7 business days. If you have a question about the holding please contact your local Postal Company.\n\n5. I am a foreign buyer, what fee will be associated with my package? \n\nAll countries have their own fee associated with packages being mailed in from a foreign buyer.  Please contact the appropriate government agency to find out what your fees will be.  All packages will be marked as goods sold without exception. It is against the law for a company in the USA to ship goods overseas to a buyer as a gift, please do not ask us to break the law.  All fees relating to the package within the buyers country will be the responsibility of the buyer.\n\n6. Do you accept returns?\n\nPlease double check the listing descriptions for all details of the items including materials and size.\nNo returns will be accepted on any personalized items. Do to the customization of the items they can not be resold to another customer and therefore all sales on these items are finial. All items will be customized EXACTLY how the words\/dates\/notes are given. If the item is damaged or not correct in anyway please contact us within 3 days of arrival of package.\nIf your item is received and it is incorrect or damaged please contact Kustom Products immediately so we can fix the problem and get another item out to you right away.\nIf the item needs to be returned or a request is made for a return label due to our error you have one week from the delivery of the label to send back the product for a full refund, any product sent out later then a week will not receive a whole refund, the shipping cost will be the responsibility of the buyer and a 50% fee of the purchase price will be given upon receipt of the items. After 3 weeks no refund will be eligible.\nAll items are personalized EXACTLY how the note is given so please check your spelling and dates!\nAll damaged items must be reported within 3 days to receive a refund or a replacement.\nIf your item arrived incorrect and can be fixed the item will be corrected or a discount offered. If the item arrived damage please contact us right away.\nIf you order an item that is not customized and you wish to return it the item will need to be returned within 3 business days in its original condition with all of its original packing insured in anyway.  The postage of the item being shipped to the buyer along with the item being shipped back to the seller will be the responsibility of the buyer. In addition there will be a 10% re-stocking free of the item upon receipt.  \nIf the item is damaged in transit on the way back to the seller the responsibility of the damage claim to recoup cost will be the responsibility of the shipping party, the buyer.\nAny non personalized item can be returned up to 5 business days after receipt of the item, any item returned and postmarked after the 3 days and up to the 5 days will be subject to a 20% re-stocking fee.\n\n7. My item came in damaged\/missing what do I do?\n\nAll damaged items must be reported with a picture of the damage as well as the box within 3 days of shown delivery. If more then 1 item is damaged\/missing please send identifiable individual pictures or one picture that shows all the damaged items together. Please send a picture of the box as well as all damaged items. As soon as the items damage is verified a new item will be sent out asap. In the case that those items are no longer available an issue for the cost of the items will be refunded.\nAny items that are not reported within the 3 days will not receive a refund or replacement item at no cost. After the 3 day time period all damage must be reported by the buyer directly to the shipping company to recoup funds lost. Most shipping companies have a 30 day window to report damage\/missing items.\n\nThe reason we require all damaged\/missing items to be reported by the buyer after the 3 day time period is USPS and FedEx has been requesting physical proof of the damage\/missing items\/packaging after that time period. As we do not have the product on hand nor the packaging this is not something we can produce.\n\nIf you wish us to report the damage\/missing item(s) for you after the 3 day time period we would be happy to do so. In that case we would report them item with your pictures. The item must be held by you until USPS makes a decision if they want physical proof of the item and\/or confirmation from you that the item is damaged\/missing. \n-If they want confirmation they will send you a letter asking for verification that you did in fact get a damaged item.\n-If they want physical proof the item\/packaging will need to be presented to your local post office.\nAfter USPS determines that the item is broken\/missing they will send a confirmation to our company.  Only after that confirmation is received will a new product be made and shipped to replace the broken\/missing item. \nWe would be happy to make you a custom listing to replace a single item if you would like to reorder. \n\n8. Do you accept cancellations on your items?\n\nDue to the orders we have and the time we are trying to turn around orders no cancellations will be excepted more then an hour after the order is made. If you need to cancel your order within an hour of purchase you must email our shop via ETSY MESSAGE ONLY to request the cancellation. Any cancellation request after an hour will not be accepted.\n\n9. Can I change what I want on my items?\n\nAs long as your product is not in production we will except changes to your item within a reasonable time frame. If we have a question about your item and what you want engraved we will contact you immediately. If we do not hear back from you within 24 hours we will move forward, if possible, on your item using the setup or style that you chose.\nFor example-If you choose a monogram style engraving and you give initials and you do not respond to an email for clarification on your engraving within 24 hours your item will move into production using the monogrammed style you chose with the letters in the exact order you sent them.\n\n10. Do you do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of your items?\n\nDue to work load I do not do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of items at no cost, doing so would add a 2-4 day extra processing time for all items. The reason is every day we get 10-20 requests for such items, the average mock up\/picture takes 5-20 minutes a piece resulting in 1-7 hours a day. If you would like a proof\/mock up\/picture of your item an extra $5 charge will be added onto your item cost per proof needed, during the holiday it is $10.\nIf you would like a proof you can purchase it in the following listing:\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/511110234\/rush-processingshippingproof?ga_search_query=rush&ref=shop_items_search_2\n\n11. For custom Images:\n\n***You must have rights to use any image that is presented to me. It is illegal for me to use ANY trademarked image (Sports teams, Disney, etc)\nAll images need to be in a vector style format as well as black and white.  A vector image is made up of paths not of pixels which results in clean lines that the laser can read. Any none vector image (.jpg for example) shows pixels which the laser will pick up and engrave onto your objects resulting in an image that will look blurry. The acceptable vector formats are: .ai, .cdr, .eps. Please note that .png images will not be acceptable. \nIf you have an image that is not a vector format such as a .jpg  that you would like to use I can either have a graphic artist trace it out for you at a cost of $10-$75 in most cases, or you can go to a site such as www.vectormagic.com  where you can sign up for free and get multiple conversions into a vector image. If you go this route I would need the .eps file that you download from the site. Please note if the image does not convert well the cost would still apply.\nAfter the image is in the correct format a minimum of a $5 fee per item will be charged.\nPlease notify us on Etsy what email you will be sending the image from and email the image to  info [!at] KustomProductsinc.com\nDue to multiple request sending the wrong format image and a lot of back and forth emails if we do not receive the correct format within 2 emails the charge will apply for the vector tracing if you would like to move forward.\n\n12. Shipping Address:\n\nPLEASE try and make sure the address that is on your order is the correct address your package needs to be shipped to in order not to have any confusion. All orders are shipped to the address per the account and all shipping cost are calculated out per the weight of your package and address. If your address is incorrect please contact through your order on ETSY asap!\nIf we change your address please note: We can only change the address in your notes and then change the address on the label. As we have NO access to your personal information we cannot change your address in your account. Therefore when the package is shipped it will initially look like it is going to the address on you account regardless of us changing the shipping address.\nIf an order is returned for an incorrect shipping address a new listing will be created for you to re-pay to ship your item. The cost is the same to re-ship your item as the initial cost of the shipping. This is because if the address w=mistake was not the fault of USPS it will cost the same amount to re-ship your package. If your address is correct and you believe the mistake is that of USPS then ONLY THE BUYER with the address can file a claim against USPS in order to recoup their lost money. There will still be a charge to re-send the package.\nAll packages that are not claimed\/re-shipped within 60 day will be discarded and no refund or credit will be made.\n\n13.  Barrel Instructions\nInstructions & Barrel Prep\n\nYour New Barrel\nKeep your barrel shrink-wrapped, out of direct sunlight in a cool (55 - 60 degree) and optimally humid (65%-75%) area until ready to use. \nBarrel Prep\nBegin by rinsing out the barrel to remove any charred bits and pieces of wood that might have shaken loose in shipping.  Using a rubber mallet, carefully tap in the spigot (just until snug) and refill the barrel with tap water.  Fill the barrel with Water.  It is normal for the barrel to drip until the wood has swelled.  Once the dripping stops, keep the water in the barrel for an additional 24 hours to fully hydrate the staves. Empty and rinse again.  Fill to the top with your favorite spirit.  Using a twist, push and turn action place the bung\/cork in tightly.\nAging\nThe length of time your spirits age and mellow in the barrel depends on  personal taste. Small barrels will begin imparting oak flavor quickly - check every two to three weeks for taste and top off what has been lost to the angels&#39; share. When pleased with your results, pour into your favorite decanter or bottle and enjoy. \nThe Rule of Thumb for Aging in Smaller Barrels\nUsing a smaller sized barrel changes the amount of surface area or the amount of wood barrel in contents. This larger ratio of wood to liquor has a direct impact on the flavor and length of the aging process and is the very reason that aging in a smaller barrel is much faster. For example, liquor can be aged out in four to six months when aging in a 20 L barrel versus years using the standard large 53-59 gallon barrel. \nThe rule of thumb for aging in smaller barrels:\n     1 L Oak Barrel - one to two weeks\nCheck your barrels and their contents every couple of weeks - top off when necessary. \nTemperature and Humidity\nTemperature also impacts the aging process due to the amount of oxidation that occurs at different temperatures. Higher temperatures accelerate this process while lower temperatures result in slower oxidation. Ideally there would be great variations between night and day temperatures. These fluctuations in temperature, along with changes in barometric pressure, have been shown to actually force the whiskey, wine or ale in and out of the wood, resulting in maximum flavor and character. \nOxygen enters a barrel when water or alcohol is lost due to evaporation - often called the &quot;angels share&quot;. In an environment with 100% relative humidity, very little water evaporates and so most of the loss is alcohol - a useful trick of one has a liquor or wine with very high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels or bottles to prevent significant oxidation. With small barrels, it&#39;s recommended to top off the barrel every one or two weeks. \nIn a nutshell ...\n- Low Humidity - primarily water lost resulting in higher alcohol content. Dry air and higher temperatures will result in more water being lost (alcohol content goes up). \n- High Humidity - primarily alcohol lost resulting in losing the alcoholic strength of the product. When stored at 60% relative humidity or higher, primarily alcohol loss. Humid atmospheres with moderate temperatures will lead to more alcohol than water evaporating. \nAdditional Information\n- As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking. Oak Barrels, Ltd. offers no guarantee against shrinkage. \n- In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung\/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung\/cork. \n- To keep your barrels performing and  looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \n- Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry. \n - Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \n- Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel.\n- As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate.\n- You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \n- Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage that is not covered by our return policy. \n- If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \n- For your safety, if using chemicals to clean\/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for proper use. \n\n14.

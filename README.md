# Etsy-Search-page-homework-
Learning Objectives
After completing this assignment, you should:

Have a deep understanding of layout
Understand how to use string interpolation
Understand DOM Manipulation
Demonstrate strong ability to navigate through a large block of JSON data
Normal Mode
Re-Create An Etsy Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

Utilize the data for whatever search term you use - DATA HERE
Copy the data into a separate js file and assign it to a variable.
You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
Everything should be styled as closely as possible, including the Header/Sidebar/Links/Search (you can ignore the footer)
You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages (items only, other links can be just linked to #)
No need to make any of the form elements work, just style them properly
You can ignore the "Top categories for ..." section as that is not in the data. You can also ignore the "Ad" icon.
Pro Tip, worry about the structure first, the JS second and the fine details of the design last

Note: The assets (heart, cart and hamburger icons) are in an assets folder for you.

Hard Mode
Create your own API token by signing up as an Etsy developer
Get the categories from the data to create the sidebar, with links that filter the listings.
Implement the sorting dropdown so that when you change the sort method the items will reload into a different order.
